    <section>
        <h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
        <p>Our project aims to develop a real-time, GPU-based visualization tool for simulating the gravitational
            effects
            of black holes on their surrounding environments. Aimed at both educational and research applications, this
            tool
            will leverage advanced graphics programming techniques to simulate complex gravitational phenomena such as
            light
            bending, redshift, gravitational lensing, and the warping of spacetime around black holes.</p>

    <section>
        <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
        <p>The visualization of black holes and their effects on the cosmos poses a significant challenge due to the
            intense
            computational resources required to accurately simulate the bending of light and spacetime. Current tools
            are
            either overly simplistic, lacking in scientific accuracy, or require significant computational time,
            limiting
            their utility for real-time applications and interactive learning. This project aims to bridge this gap by
            utilizing the power of modern GPU computing to bring these celestial phenomena to life in real-time,
            offering a
            useful tool for both scientific research and public science education.</p>

    <section>
        <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <h3 class="goal">Baseline Goals:</h3>
        <p>We plan to deliver a series of images and videos simulating the following effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Gravitational Lensing: </b>Images showcasing how light from distant stars is bent around the black hole,
                creating
                arcs and rings. This effect will be highlighted in both static images and as part of the interactive
                demo,
                allowing users to observe changes in lensing as they adjust the mass and spin of the black hole.</li>
            <li><b>Accretion Disk Illumination: </b>Simulations that depict the swirling gas and dust in the accretion disk
                around the
                black hole, heated to extreme temperatures and emitting high-energy radiation. The visualization will
                demonstrate variations in disk appearance based on the black hole's spin and the observer's angle.</li>
            <li><b>Event Horizon and Photon Sphere: </b>Visualizations focusing on the event horizon's silhouette against the
                backdrop
                of the accretion disk and the photon sphere, where gravitational forces are so strong that light orbits
                the
                black hole. These phenomena will be interactive, demonstrating how the size and shape of the shadow
                change with
                the black hole's properties.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Interactive Interface Goals:</b>
        <p>
        <p>Build an interactive interface allowing users to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Manipulate Black Hole Parameters: </b>Users can adjust the mass, spin, and charge of the black hole to see
                real-time
                changes in gravitational lensing, event horizon shadow, and accretion disk behavior.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3 class="goal">Aspirational Goals:</h3>
        <p>If things go well, we also want to achieve the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Observer Positioning: </b>Through an intuitive interface, users can change their viewing angle and distance
                from the black hole, offering diverse perspectives on the gravitational effects.</li>
            <li><b>Integrate Real Data: </b>To integrate real astronomical data that is publicly available into the simulation,
                allowing for the visualization of black holes within actual galactic environments.</li>
        </ul>
